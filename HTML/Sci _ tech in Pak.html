        <h2 id="INTRODUCTION ABOUT SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY"> <ins> INTRODUCTION ABOUT SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY </ins></h2>
        <p> Science and technology is a topic that encompasses science, technology, and the interactions between the two. Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of explanations and predictions about nature and the universe. Technology is the collection of techniques, methods or processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation, or any other consumer demands.<br>
            Science may drive technological development, by generating demand for new instruments to address a scientific question, or by illustrating technical possibilities previously unconsidered. In turn, technology may drive scientific investigation, by creating demand for technological improvements that can only be produced through research, and by raising questions about the underlying principles that a new technology relies on. <br>
            For the majority of human history, technological improvements were achieved by chance, trial and error, or spontaneous inspiration. When the modern scientific enterprise matured in the Enlightenment, it primarily concerned itself with basic questions of nature. Research and development directed towards immediate technical application is a relatively recent occurrence, arising with the Industrial Revolution and becoming commonplace in the 20th century.

        <h2 id="ABOUT TOPIC"> <ins> ABOUT TOPIC </ins> </h2>
        <p> As we have discuss above about the meaning of Science and Technology, now moving towards the topic. We are going to discuss the past development of Science & Technology in Pakistan and the present state of it in Pakistan comparing with the Muslim World.
        </p>

        <h2 id="SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN PAKISTAN"> <ins> SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN PAKISTAN </ins></h2>
        <p> Since independence in 1947, Pakistan has seen an influx of scientists, engineers, doctors, and technicians in the growing field of science and technology. Pakistan is known for possession of strong weapons in the military, a growing base of doctors and engineers, and software engineers.
        </p>

        <h2> <ins> Nuclear Science</ins></h2>
        <p> Under the leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan tested six indigenously developed atomic devices in 1998. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear power country in the world.<br>
            As of 2017, nuclear power in Pakistan is provided by 5 commercial nuclear power plants. Pakistan is the first Muslim country in the world to construct and operate civil nuclear power plants. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), the scientific and nuclear governmental agency, is solely responsible for operating these power plants. As of 2012, the electricity generated by commercial nuclear power plants constitutes roughly 3.6% of electricity generated in Pakistan, compared to 62% from fossil fuel, 33% from hydroelectric power and 0.3% from coal electricity. Pakistan is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Pakistan plans on constructing 32 nuclear power plants by 2050.

        <h2 id="PAKISTAN AND MUSLIM WORLD"> <ins> PAKISTAN AND MUSLIM WORLD </ins></h2>
        <p> The Muslim world is in a state of turmoil. I use the term “Muslim world”asa collective classification not meant as a Manichean opposite to the ‘civilised’ West, but because the concept of Ummah is a creedal belief that resonates with 1.5 billion Muslims around the world.<br>
            Pakistan stands today as the strongest Muslim nation state from a military perspective; being the only Muslim country with nuclear weapons and a standing army of nearly 700,000 personnel (sixth biggest in the world) – no other Muslim country comes close.<br>
            Hence,<br>	
            Pakistan is a beacon of hope for muslim world.
        </p>

        <h2 id="CONCLUSION"> <ins> CONCLUSION </ins></h2>
        <p> It needs to be understood that development is a multifaceted process, and a number of factors must dovetail together before economic growth and progress can occur. In my opinion, five key components must come together. First, the development process must be built on a foundation of high degrees of literacy and quality education at all levels. The Afro-Asian countries have vast populations at their disposal, and the challenge is to transform this resource into wealth. In order to unleash their creativity, the Third World countries must expose their youth to a challenging educational environment that teaches them to think and find novel solutions to difficult problems.<br>

            The government has taken many steps to improve the standard of education and research in Pakistan, the most important step, in my opinion, is the establishment of the Higher Education Commission. The commission, which is in the process of formulation, has already done good work to prepare its action plan for attainment of international standards in the quality of education, research, and development. The commission is working to tailor higher education programmes to national needs and socio-economic development. The government has announced a substantial increase in funding to universities through the commission. <br>
            
            In Pakistan, due to negligence and faulty vision of planners in successive governments, the science and technology sector was never given the status required to effectively use it as a contributor to national and economic growth. Due to meagre funding provided by the government, our R&D institutions could not produce any valuable research. Lack of proper facilities and environment for research in the universities and research institutes led to deterioration in the standard of higher education to the extent that today our universities have been relegated to the status of low-level colleges in which valuable university-economy links are totally missing.
